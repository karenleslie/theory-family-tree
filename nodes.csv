Transcendental Realism,"Transcendental realism is one analytical element of critical realism [1].

Transcendental realism argue that nature can exist independently of men and this is a critical stance against transcendental idealism, where object do not exist independently of human activity [2]. However, both transcendental idealism and transcendental realism ""agree that there could be no knowledge without social activity of science."" [3]

Basker described Transcendental realism as opposition to the empirical realism. According to Basker, empirical realist tends to fall into the ""epistemic fallacy"" where they tend to couple ontology and epistemology [4].


Note: Initially Bhaskar used the word transcendental realism to refer to critical realism but later transcendental was replaced by critical. Bhaskar originally used to word transcendental realism to compare to Kant's transcendental idealism and empirical realism. ","[1] ""...critical realism has two analytical elements which we have linked in this book. One is a general ontology, originally called transcendental realism. The other is an attempt to apply this to the social scientific field, originally called critical naturalism. By and by, however, these two elements have been brought together in reports of the perspective, and the concept of ‚Äòcritical realism‚Äô has only been established afterwards."" (Danermark, Ekstrom, Jakobsen, & Karlsson, 2002, p. 198)

[2] ""Transcendental realism argues that it is necessary to assume for the intelligibility of science that the order discovered in nature exists independently of men, i.e. of human activity in general. Transcendental idealism maintains that this order is actually imposed by men in their cognitive activity."" (Bhaskar, 2008, p. 17)

[3] ""Both transcendental realism and transcendental idealism reject the empiricist account of science, according to which its valid content is exhausted by atomistic facts and their conjunctions. Both agree that there could be no knowledge without the social activity of science."" (Bhaskar, 2008, p. 17)

[4] ""In the empirical realist tradition the epistemic fallacy thus covers or disguises an ontology based on the category of experience, and a realism based on the presumed characteristics of the objects of experiences, viz. atomistic events, and their relations, viz. constant conjunctions."" (Bhaskar, 2008, p. 30)

""Bhaskar refers to this as the ‚Äòepistemic fallacy‚Äô; by which he means the tendency to couple ontology and epistemology and to confuse that which exists with the knowledge we have about it (what we believe). These things should be kept separate, according to Bhaskar."" (Alvesson & Sk√∂ldberg, 2009, p. 40)

Folklore,"To add to Methods, alongside Ethnography: There are several goals of active folklore research. The first objective is to identity tradition bearers within a social group and to collect their lore, preferably in situ. Once collected, these data need to be documented and preserved to enable further access and study. The documented lore is then available to be analyzed and interpreted by folklorists and other cultural historians, and can become the basis for studies of either individual customs or comparative studies. There are multiple venues, be they museums, journals or folk festivals to present the research results. The final step in this methodology involves advocating for these groups in their distinctiveness.","Wilson, William (2006). ""Essays on Folklore by William A. Wilson"".

Embodied Cognition ,"Embodied Cognition theoretical perspective is based on major two claims based on empirical evidances from many research studies over last two decades- First, the embodied aspect of cognition, gestures play a key role in mathematical knowledge. Gestures in mathematical discussion help learners to collaborate discourse practices like explaining, refuting, and building on each other‚Äôs reasoning. Second, a  familiar context of the mathematical problem allows students to approach the problem more effectively.

Participatory Design ,"Participatory design is a research method that involves subjects in the design process. The idea is to bring the community for which the design is developed to think about the best ways to use it. Participatory Design methodology views communities as an essential element in designing a new solution. It views the community participants as the target audience of the design, for whom the product is intended. If the researcher plans to make practical contributions to a community, then using this type of methodology is a widely accepted way to achieve the best results. Studies discuss how participatory design can resolve social justice issues, such as equity, as participatory design views its design collaborators as equal contributors to the design and allows them to express their perspectives and address their issues more inclusively. Moreover, in recent years, researchers have indicated the importance of paying close attention to the community's needs during the design process itself, as demonstrated and discussed by Harrington, Erete & Piper (2019). 

The participatory design tries to include different views to create more inclusive products and solutions to close the gap between research and practice.  
The research team might include the participants in different design stages and take their inputs on the idea, a prototype, or complete design. Druin (2001) discusses four different roles the community can have in the design process in participatory design research. Participants might be viewed:
1. As design partners, participants engage with the design from its early stages and collaborate with the researchers at all development stages. 
2. As informants, participants are part of many different design stages but are not as involved as the design partners are. Researchers may want to sample their perceptions, ideas, and thinking process in various design stages (When viewing participants as informants, the researchers can view them both as users and testers). 
3. As testers, participants would engage with the developed prototype and answer the researchers' questions. Researchers might observe participants' thinking process when using the design. 
4. As users, participants would engage with the product while the researchers observe or ask them questions.","Druin (2001); Harrigton, Erete, & Piper (2019)","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_design#:~:text=Participatory%20design%20(originally%20co%2Doperative,their%20needs%20and%20is%20usable.",

Feminist standpoint theory,"Cultural expectations and conventions in patriarchal societies limit women to certain roles with differential access to resources. The result is that women hold and produce different types of knowledge from their male counterparts, and that these different types of knowledge should be recognized and utilized as a resource, rather than marginalized. Feminist standpoint theory thus attempts to reconfigure the epistemic terrain and valorize the marginal perspectives of knowledge, so as to expose the unexamined assumptions of dominant epistemological paradigms, avoid distorted or one-sided accounts of social life, and generate new and critical questions (Bardzell, 2010)

Feminist theorists must demand that feminist theorizing be grounded in women‚Äôs material activity and must as well be a part of the political struggle necessary to develop areas of social life modeled on this activity. The outcome could be the development of a political economy which included women‚Äôs activity as well as men‚Äôs, and could as well be a step toward the redefining and restructuring of society as a whole on the basis of women‚Äôs activity (Hartsock, 1983)","Bardzell, S.

When the big data age comes, Amazon Mechanical Turk is a popular platform to get data among various crowdsourcing platforms.

Structural Functionalism,"Structural functionalism is a sociological and anthropological theory that suggests societies are built on individual components, such as institutions, organizations, and overall practices. In order for a society to continue to function, each of these pieces must continue to serve and interact with the others. Therefore, structural functionalism views social change as an adaptation to social strain or tension (Encyclopedia Britannica, n.d.). It was originally formulated in direct opposition to evolutionism, the theory that societies begin as simple structures and slowly develop into larger entities. Critics of structural functionalism point out that it is historically based in political and economic structures, and fails to acknowledge the role of belief and symbolism in cultures (""Structural functionalism,"" n.d.).",AnthroBase.

Information Horizon Maps,"‚ÄúThe methodology primarily consists of an interview during which study participants are asked to provide a graphical and verbal articulation of their information horizon in a particular context. That is, each study participant is asked to draw a map of his or her information horizons showing all information resources, including people, they typically access when seeking information within a specific context. Each study participant is also asked to describe the information resources and explain their importance and role in the information-seeking process.‚Äù (Sonnenwald, 2001, p. 191)

‚Äúthe concept/theory of information horizons suggest that certain types of data are important for increasing our understanding of human information behavior. These data include decisions made and activities undertaken during the information seeking process; when and why information resources, including individuals, are accessed (and not accessed); relationships or interconnectedness among information resources; individual preferences and evaluation of information resources; the proactive nature of information resources; and the impact of contexts and situations on the information seeking process.
The methodological question addressed by the current study is whether study participants would be able to articulate or describe their information horizons graphically and verbally. Such graphical and verbal articulation could provide an extremely rich view of people‚Äôs information horizons and information behavior in general.‚Äù (Sonnenwald et al., 2005, p. 4-5)

‚ÄúThe combination of graphic and verbal representations of the participants‚Äô information horizons provided much more breadth and much more depth than is possible to attain through use of the more traditional surveys of people‚Äôs resource use. The maps consolidate the information reported in multiple specific information seeking incidents, thus integrating the generality of the map with the specificity of critical incident reports. This technique is much less labor intensive than direct observation of people‚Äôs information seeking activities. Finally, the method itself (incorporating both verbal description and graphical representation) provides data triangulation, thus improving its validity.‚Äù (Sonnenwald et al., 2005, p. 19)","Sonnenwald, D.

Verstehen,"The manifestation of postpositivism in the social sciences can be found in the work of Max Weber who established the concept of ""Verstehen"". The concept of Verstehen emphasizes the recognition of the social world that social realities need to be understood from the perspective of the subject rather than that of the observer and in totality rather than in isolation (Given, 2008). The process of Verstehen involves understanding the intention and context of these social realities for the subject herself or himself (Given, 2008). To take a postpositivist approach, one needs to incorporate qualitative methods and triangulation through many sources to enable verstehen (Sifat, 2016). ","Given, L. M. (2008).
